              In January 2001, Chenel Pierre founded Chenel Super Service, LLC in Immokalee, Florida, initially offering assistance with various documents such as letters, forms, phone calls, translations, and predominantly, income tax and immigration documents. The demand for his tax services skyrocketed, leading him to work exhaustively from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM during tax seasons. His dedication to the community fostered a mutual affection and ensured a steady flow of clients who always paid on time.<br /><br />
Chenel, while managing his business, furthered his education by studying Applied Behavioral Science and Business Science Management at National Louis University, completing an associate degree at Edison Community College, and briefly attending Florida Gulf Coast University. Despite his academic achievements, the success of Chenel Super Service was mainly attributed to his innate ability to learn, adapt, and teach others, as he never received formal training in the services offered by his company.<br /><br />
Over the years, Chenel has assisted countless Haitians in entering the US, earning their citizenship, and gaining asylum. Inspired to broaden his impact, in January 2023, he expanded his services to help more undocumented immigrants in the US by collaborating with a diverse team of attorneys, journalists, politicians, and economists worldwide.<br /><br />
Currently, Chenel Super Service operates from two locations, Immokalee and Fort Myers, Florida, but its team is globally distributed, including writers in Canada, France, the US, Haiti, and other employees in Pakistan and the Dominican Republic. The ultimate objective of Chenel Super Service is to serve as a beacon of hope for all undocumented immigrants in the US, guiding them towards a legal and secure future.
